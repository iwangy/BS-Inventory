# BS Inventory Heatmap

BSInventory Heatmap I've visualized the BS I've encountered and BS I've created using d3.js.

## Features

- Visualize my created and encountered "BS" activities on a calendar heatmap.
- Each cell represents a day, and the color intensity indicates the quantity of "BS" activities.
- Hover over the grid to view details of your activities.
- Legend provided for interpreting the intensity of "bullshit" activities.
